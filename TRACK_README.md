This repo contains the grammar for the replace-this-with-the-track-name language.
The repo comes with a tiny grammar that shows some basic grammar that you can tweak for your purposes.

```json

```

## Install

- Yarn: `yarn add @exercism/highlightjs-replace-this-with-the-track-slug`
- Bun: `bun add @exercism/highlightjs-replace-this-with-the-track-slug`

## Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/)

## Resources

- [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/docs/)
- [Lezer](https://lezer.codemirror.net/docs/guide/)
  - [Writing a Grammar](https://lezer.codemirror.net/docs/guide/#writing-a-grammar)

## Structure

The repo's source files are defined in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

The repo is structured as follows:

```text
.
├── src
│   ├── index.ts (the main plugin)
│   ├── syntax.grammar (the Lezer grammar)
│   └── syntax.grammar.d.ts (the grammar typings)
├── test
│   ├── cases (test cases)
│   │   └ *.txt (test case)
│   └── grammar.test.ts (test file)
├── index.html (dev server file)
├── rollup.config.js (bundling config)
├── tsconfig.json (typescript confif)
└── vite.config.js (vite dev server config)
```

## Setup

Run `bun install` to install all dependencies.

## Developing

To help with development, run `bun run dev`.
This will start a [Vite](https://vite.dev/) dev server (usually at http://localhost:5173/) that renders the `index.html` file.
The `#editor` element gets populated with some sample source code of your choosing and then it will get transformed by the grammar defined in `src/syntax.grammar`.
Any changes to the grammar will auto-refresh the dev server's rendered contents.

## Testing

The `test/cases` directory contains the tests files.
Run `bun test` to run these tests.

Note: test (case) files should be relatively small and focus on a single aspect of a grammar.

## Publishing

Run `bun publish` to publish the plugin to NPM.
